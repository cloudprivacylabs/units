# Units

This is a RESTful front-end to the Unified Code for Units of Measure
(UCUM) library. It extends the UCUM interface with a
regular-expression based unit matching functionality to extend UCUM to
handle common nonstandard measure representations, such as 5'6" for
length.

The homepage for UCUM is: https://ucum.nlm.nih.gov/
